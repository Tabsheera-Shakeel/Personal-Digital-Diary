## 📖 About the Project

This project began with a personal challenge:  
As someone who loves journaling, I often found it hard to write freely in public or carry a physical diary everywhere. Inspired by this need, I created a **Digital Diary** using **Python, Streamlit, and SQLite** — a place where anyone can write privately, reflect on life, and stay emotionally organized on the go.
